      deliveries of goods shall be made by the agency that  makes  the  direct
      purchase  other  than  under  a  vendor  contract.  The  commissioner of
      citywide administrative  services  may  authorize  an  agency  to  which
      delivery  is  made  to  perform  such functions on purchases made by the
      department of citywide administrative services subject to standards  and
      policies  of  the  commissioner. The comptroller may continue to perform
      such  inspectional  duties  as  are  necessary  for  auditing  purposes,
      including  ascertainment  of whether items purchased and paid for by the
      department of citywide administrative services or  other  agencies  have
      been received and put to use by agencies.
