Section 1151. ::    
        
     
        ยง  1151.    Effect  of this charter on existing law.  a.  All laws and
      parts of laws relating to or affecting the  city  of  New  York  or  the
      municipalities  consolidated  therein  in  force  when  this  charter as
      amended shall take effect are hereby  repealed  and  superseded  to  the
      extent  that  the  same  are  inconsistent  with  the provisions of this
      charter and no further.
        b.  All other laws and parts of laws shall  continue  in  force  until
      repealed, amended, modified or superseded.
        c.  Insofar as the provisions of this charter are the same in terms or
      in  substance and effect as provisions of law in force when this charter
      shall take effect, relating to or affecting the city of  New  York,  the
      provisions  of this charter are intended to be not a new enactment but a
      continuation of such provisions of law, and this  charter  shall  be  so
      construed and applied.
