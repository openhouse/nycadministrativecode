      such building was vacant during  the  progress  of  the  work,  until  a
      certificate  of  occupancy  has been issued;  in case such an alteration
      does not necessitate the vacating of the building during the progress of
      the work, the occupancy or use of the building shall not  continue  more

      officer or member thereof, unless  and  until  the  certificate  is  set
      aside,  vacated  or  modified by the board of standards and appeals or a
      court of competent jurisdiction upon  the  application  of  the  agency,

      requirement sought to be made or issued shall be served upon  the  owner

      demonstration  construction  not in compliance with the building code in
      order to obtain  knowledge  and  information  not  supplied  from  other
      experiments  within  the  city;    the  owner of such construction shall
      conduct such periodic tests and  evaluations  as  the  commissioner  may
      specify and submit results and reports to the department of buildings as
      the   commissioner  may  require;    except  as  otherwise  specifically
      permitted by the commissioner, the construction  shall  be  erected  and
      maintained  in  accordance with all provisions of applicable laws, rules
      and regulations.

      commissioner, prior to recordation with the city register or the  county
      clerk in the case of Staten Island the following:
