      Not later than the sixth day of May, each borough president shall submit
      to the mayor and the council a response to the mayor's executive budget.
      Such response shall indicate which  of  the  recommended  appropriations
      submitted  by  the  borough  president pursuant to   section two hundred
      forty-five, which were not  included  by  the  mayor  in  the  executive
      budget, should be considered by the council for inclusion in the budget.
      Any  appropriations  recommended  in  this  manner  for inclusion in the
      budget shall be accompanied by recommendations for offsetting reductions
      in other appropriations within the  borough.    Any  such  increases  or
      reductions  must be stated separately and distinctly and refer each to a
