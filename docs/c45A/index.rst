      of  the city unless otherwise provided for by executive order, rule, law
      or pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.  The  office  shall  be
      directed by the chief administrative law judge, who shall be an attorney
      admitted  to  practice for at least five years in the state of New York.
      The chief administrative law judge shall be appointed by the mayor.
        2. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of  law  and  except  as
      provided  in  subdivision  five  of  this  section,  the  mayor shall be
      authorized to designate by executive order the office of  administrative
      trials and hearings as the tribunal for the impartial administration and
      conduct  of  adjudicatory  hearings  for violations of this charter, the
      administrative code of the city of New York, rules promulgated  pursuant
      to  this  charter or such code and any other laws, rules, regulations or
      other policies enforced or implemented  by  the  agencies  of  the  city
      through  the  conduct  of adjudications. Pursuant to any such order, the
      mayor may transfer entire tribunals or parts thereof, or  categories  of
      adjudications  to  such office, which may perform such responsibilities,
      including responsibilities delegated elsewhere by this charter or  other
      law, as the mayor shall direct in such order. In furtherance of any such
      order,  agencies  shall  be  authorized to establish their tribunals, or
      parts thereof, within such office. No existing right or  remedy  of  any
      character shall be lost, impaired or affected by reason of a transfer of
      a tribunal or part thereof or category of adjudications pursuant to this
      subdivision except as may be necessary to implement such transfer.
        3.  Any  order issued by the mayor pursuant to subdivision two of this
      section may include provision for matters pending at the time  that  any
      transfer  pursuant  to  such  subdivision  shall  take effect and may in
      appropriate instances deem agency rules in effect on  the  date  of  any
      transfer  to  be  rules  of  the  office  of  administrative  trials and
      hearings. Any such order may in addition address circumstances in  which
      agencies shall continue to make final findings of fact and/or decisions,
      determinations or orders.
        4.  (a)  The  mayor  shall  constitute  a  committee  to  evaluate the
      adjudicatory  functions  carried  out  by  city  agencies  and  to  make
      recommendations  with respect to the transfers authorized by subdivision
      two of this section. Such committee shall be chaired by the deputy mayor
      for legal affairs or another  designee  of  the  mayor.  It  shall  have
      representatives  from  the office of administrative trials and hearings,
      the law department, the department of citywide  administrative  services
      and  any  other  agency  the  mayor  deems  necessary  to  implement the
      transfers described in this section. The work of such committee shall be
      deemed  complete  upon  submission  to  the  mayor  of  a  final  report
      identifying   the   tribunals   or   parts  thereof,  or  categories  of
      adjudications, that have been consolidated or that should be  considered
      for  future  consolidation, provided that the mayor may reconstitute the
      committee at any  time  to  perform  the  functions  described  in  this
      section.
        (b) Before recommending transfers of tribunals or parts thereof, or of
      categories  of  adjudications, the committee shall solicit comments from
      the public, including, to the extent practicable, any  segments  of  the
      public  particularly  affected by such transfers. In furtherance of such
      solicitation, the committee or a person  or  agency  designated  by  the
      committee shall hold a public hearing, on notice of at least twenty days
      published  in  the  City Record. Such notice shall specify the transfers
      that are under consideration by the committee for recommendation to  the
      mayor.
    
        (c)  The  authority  conferred  upon the mayor by subdivisions two and
      three of this section shall not be limited by  or  contingent  upon  the
      requirements of this subdivision.
        5.  Subdivisions  two  through four of this section shall not apply to
      the office of administrative tax appeals, including the  tax  commission
      and the tax appeals tribunal, or the board of standards and appeals.

      that issues  notices  of  violations  returnable  to  the  environmental
      control  board  may  delegate  authority  to appear on its behalf to any
      representative authorized to appear on behalf of any other  city  agency
      that issues notices of violation returnable to the environmental control
      board; and
    
        (3)  providing  that  if (i) a hearing has been adjourned by a hearing

      hearing  date,  and  (iii)  such  officer of such agency fails to timely
      appear on the adjourned hearing date, then  the  hearing  shall  not  be

      regulations relating thereto which the board of health shall designate.
        (3) The board shall have authority from time to time  to  make,  amend
      and  rescind such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out
      its duties under this subdivision.
        d. (1) (a) The environmental control board shall  conduct  proceedings
      for  the  adjudication  of violations of the laws, rules and regulations
      enforced by it pursuant to the  provisions  of  subdivision  c  of  this
      section   or   of  any  other  law  providing  for  enforcement  by  the
      environmental control board in accordance with this  paragraph  (1)  and
      with  rules and regulations promulgated by the board, and shall have the
    
      power to render decisions and orders and to impose the  civil  penalties
      provided under law for such violations.
        (b)  The  form and wording of notices of violation shall be prescribed
      by the board. The notice of violation or copy thereof when filled in and
      served shall constitute notice of the violation charged, and,  if  sworn
      to  or  affirmed,  shall  be prima facie evidence of the facts contained
      therein.
        (c) The notice of violation shall  contain  information  advising  the
      person  charged  of  the  manner  and  the time in which such person may
      either admit or deny the violation charged in the notice. Such notice of
      violation shall also contain a warning to advise the person charged that
      failure to plead in the manner and time stated in the notice may  result
      in  a  default decision and order being entered against such person. The
      original or a copy of  the  notice  of  violation  shall  be  filed  and
      retained  by the board and shall be deemed a record kept in the ordinary
      course of business.
        (d) Where a respondent has failed to plead within the time allowed  by
      the  rules  of the board or has failed to appear on a designated hearing
      date or a subsequent date following  an  adjournment,  such  failure  to
      plead or appear shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be an admission of
      liability  and  shall  be  grounds  for rendering a default decision and
      order imposing a penalty in the maximum amount prescribed under law  for
      the violation charged.
        (e)  Where  a  proceeding  has been referred by the board to a hearing
      officer, upon the failure of any party to respond properly to  a  lawful
      discovery order or request made pursuant to rules of the board governing
      discovery,  or  upon any party's wrongful refusal to answer questions or
      produce documents, the hearing officer may take whatever  action  he  or
      she  deems  appropriate  including,  but  not  limited to, preclusion of
      evidence or witnesses, or striking the pleadings  or  defenses  of  such
      party.  It shall not be necessary for a party to have been subpoenaed to
      appear or produce documents at any properly ordered discovery proceeding
      for such sanctions to be applicable.
        (f) Where the rules of the board permit exceptions to  be  filed  with
      the  board from a recommended decision and order issued pursuant to this
      subdivision and such exceptions are filed pursuant to the rules  of  the
      board,  if  no  final decision and order has been issued by the board to
      the parties after the expiration of one hundred  eighty  days  from  the
      filing  of  the  exceptions,  a respondent who filed such exceptions may
      seek, at any time after the expiration of the one hundred  eighty  days,
      judicial  review pursuant to article seventy-eight of the New York civil
      practice law and rules, and if a respondent  does  so,  the  recommended
      decision  and  order issued pursuant to this subdivision shall be deemed
      the final decision and order of the board, provided that  no  respondent
      may rely upon this subparagraph to have a recommended decision and order
      deemed  a  final  decision  and  order of the board unless: (i) at least
      forty-five days before the filing of any petition  pursuant  to  article
      seventy-eight  of  the  New  York  civil  practice  law  and rules, such
      respondent shall have filed with the board written notice,  pursuant  to
      its rules, of the respondent's intention to file such petition; and (ii)
      such  respondent  has  served such petition on the board pursuant to the
      New York civil practice law and rules.  The  board  may  issue  a  final
      decision  and  order at any time after the respondent has filed with the
      board written notice of his or her  intention  to  file  such  petition,
      provided  that the respondent has not filed such petition on a day prior
      to the board's issuance of its final decision.
        (g) Any final order of the board imposing a civil penalty, whether the
      adjudication was had by hearing or  upon  default  or  otherwise,  shall
    
      constitute  a judgment rendered by the board which may be entered in the
      civil court of the city of New York or any other place provided for  the
      entry  of  civil judgments within the state, and may be enforced without
      court  proceedings  in  the  same  manner  as  the  enforcement of money
      judgments entered in civil actions;  provided,  however,  that  no  such
      judgment  shall be entered which exceeds the sum of twenty-five thousand
      dollars for each respondent.
        (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, before a  judgment  based
      upon  a  default  may  be  so  entered  the board must have notified the
      respondent by first class mail in such form as the board may direct: (i)
      of the default decision and order and the penalty imposed; (ii)  that  a
      judgment  will  be entered in the civil court of the city of New York or
      any other place provided for the entry of  civil  judgments  within  the
      state  of New York; and (iii) that entry of such judgment may be avoided
      by requesting a  stay  of  default  for  good  cause  shown  and  either
      requesting  a  hearing  or  entering a plea pursuant to the rules of the
      board within thirty days of the mailing of such notice.
        (i) A judgment entered pursuant to this paragraph shall remain in full
      force and effect for eight years.
        (j) Notwithstanding any  inconsistent  provision  of  section  fifteen
      hundred  four  of  the  New York city civil court act, an execution with
      respect to a judgment of the board arising out of  any  violation  of  a
      provision  of chapter one of title sixteen of the administrative code of
      the city of New York shall be directed only to the sheriff.
        (k) The  board  shall  develop  and  implement  technology  to  enable
      electronic  case  management,  including  but  not  limited  to:  online
      adjudication  and  payments  in  appropriate   cases;   more   efficient
      administration  of  case  conferences,  hearings and appeals; electronic
      case scheduling; and generation of data and other reports to enhance the
      efficiency and increase  public  accountability  of  board  adjudication
      functions.  Not  later  than December 1, 2008, the board shall report to
      the  city  council  on  its  plans  and  progress  in   fulfilling   the
      requirements  of  this  subparagraph  and  shall include in its report a
      projected schedule for implementation.
        (2) (a) The environmental control board  shall  not  enter  any  final
      decision  or  order  pursuant to the provisions of paragraph one of this
      subdivision unless the notice of violation shall have been served in the
      same manner as is prescribed for service of process by article three  of
      the  civil  practice  law  and  rules  or  article three of the business
      corporation law, except that:
        (i) service of a notice of violation of any provisions of the  charter
      or administrative code the enforcement of which is the responsibility of
      the  fire  commissioner, the commissioner of buildings, the commissioner
      of environmental protection, the  commissioner  of  transportation,  the
      commissioner  of  small  business  services,  the landmarks preservation
      commission  or  the  commissioner  of  the  department  of   information
      technology  and  telecommunications  and  over  which  the environmental
      control board has jurisdiction, may be made by delivering such notice to
      a person employed by  the  respondent  on  or  in  connection  with  the
      premises  where  the  violation  occurred,  provided  however,  that the
      department of buildings and the fire  department  may  not  utilize  the
      procedures  set  forth  in  this  item  to  serve  a notice of violation
      relating to commercial premises or residential  premises  with  a  legal
      occupancy of four or more dwelling units; and
        (ii)  service of a notice of violation of any provision of the charter
      or administrative code, the enforcement of which is  the  responsibility
      of  the commissioner of sanitation, the commissioner of buildings or the
      commissioner of the fire department and  over  which  the  environmental
    
      control board has jurisdiction, may be made by affixing such notice in a
      conspicuous place to the premises where the violation occurred; and
        (iii)  service  of  a  notice  of  violation  of  any provision of the
      administrative code relating to the prevention of noise pollution caused
      by  an  audible  motor  vehicle  burglar  alarm  and  over   which   the
      environmental  control  board  has  jurisdiction  may be served upon the
      owner of a motor vehicle by affixing such notice to said  vehicle  in  a
      conspicuous place; and
        (iv)  service  of  a  notice  of violation of any of the provisions of
      section 10-119 or 10-120 of the administrative code of the city  of  New
      York  and  over  which the environmental control board has jurisdiction,
      may be  made  by  certified  mail,  return  receipt  requested,  to  the
      respondent's  last  known  residence  or business address, provided that
      delivery of such notice shall be restricted to the  respondent.  Service
