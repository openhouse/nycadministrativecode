Chapter 1: Commission on Human Rights
--------------------------------------------------
§ 8-101 Policy.  ::


In the city of New York, with its great cosmopolitan population, there is no greater danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against one another and antagonistic to each other because of their actual or perceived differences, including those based on race, color, creed, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, uniformed service, any lawful source of income, status as a victim of domestic violence or status as a victim of sex offenses or stalking, whether children are, may be or would be residing with a person or conviction or arrest record. The council hereby finds and declares that prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination, bias-related violence or harassment and disorder occasioned thereby threaten the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state. The council further finds and declares that gender-based harassment threatens the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. A city agency is hereby created with power to eliminate and prevent discrimination from playing any role in actions relating to employment, public accommodations, and housing and other real estate, and to take other actions against prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, discrimination, sexual harassment and bias-related violence or harassment as herein provided; and the commission established hereunder is hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.

13. Employer liability for discriminatory conduct by employee, agent or independent contractor.

   a. An employer shall be liable for an unlawful discriminatory practice based upon the conduct of an employee or agent which is in violation of any provision of this section other than subdivisions one and two of this section.

   b. An employer shall be liable for an unlawful discriminatory practice based upon the conduct of an employee or agent which is in violation of subdivision one or two of this section only where:

      (1) the employee or agent exercised managerial or supervisory responsibility; or

      (2) the employer knew of the employee's or agent's discriminatory conduct, and acquiesced in such conduct or failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action; an employer shall be deemed to have knowledge of an employee's or agent's discriminatory conduct where that conduct was known by another employee or agent who exercised managerial or superivsory responsibility; or

      (3) the employer should have known of the employee's or agent's discriminatory conduct and failed to exercise reasonable diligence to prevent such discriminatory conduct.

   c. An employer shall be liable for an unlawful discriminatory practice committed by a person employed as an independent contractor, other than an agent of such employer, to carry out work in furtherance of the employer's business enterprise only where such discriminatory conduct was committed in the course of such employment and the employer had actual knowledge of and acquiesced in such conduct.

   d. Where liability of an employer has been established pursuant to this section and is based solely on the conduct of an employee, agent, or independent contractor, the employer shall be permitted to plead and prove to the discriminatory conduct for which it was found liable it had:

      (1) Established and complied with policies, programs and procedures for the prevention and detection of unlawful discriminatory practices by employees, agents and persons employed as independent contractors, including but not limited to:

         (i) A meaningful and responsive procedure for investigating complaints of discriminatory practices by employees, agents and persons employed as independent contractors and for taking appropriate action against those persons who are found to have engaged in such practices;

   e. The demonstration of any or all of the factors listed above in addition to any other relevant factors shall be considered in mitigation of the amount of civil penalties to be imposed by the commission pursuant to this chapter or in mitigation of civil penalties or punitive damages which may be imposed pursuant to chapter four or five of this title and shall be among the factors considered in determining an employer's liability under subparagraph three of paragraph b of this subdivision.

   f. The commission may establish by rule policies, programs and procedures which may be implemented by employers for the prevention and detection of unlawful discriminatory practices by employees, agents and persons employed as independent contractors. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employer found to be liable for an unlawful discriminatory practice based solely on the conduct of an employee, agent or person employed as an independent contractor who pleads and proves that such policies, programs and procedures had been implemented and complied with at the time of the unlawful conduct shall not be liable for any civil penalties which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter or any civil penalties or punitive damages which may be imposed pursuant to chapter four or five of this title for such unlawful discriminatory practice.

14. Applicability; alienage or citizenship status. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it shall not be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person to discriminate on the ground of alienage or citizenship status, or to make any inquiry as to a person's alienage or citizenship status, or to give preference to a person who is a citizen or a national of the United States over an equally qualified person who is an alien, when such discrimination is required or when such preference is expressly permitted by any law or regulation of the United States, the state of New York or the city of New York, and when such law or regulation does not provide that state or local law may be more protective of aliens; provided, however, that this provision shall not prohibit inquiries or determinations based on alienage or citizenship status when such actions are necessary to obtain the benefits of a federal program. An applicant for a license or permit issued by the city of New York may be required to be authorized to work in the United States whenever by law or regulation there is a limit on the number of such licenses or permits which may be issued.

15. Applicability; persons with disabilities.

   (a) Requirement to make reasonable accommodation to the needs of persons with disabilities. Except as provided in paragraph (b), any person prohibited by the provisions of this section from discriminating on the basis of disability shall make reasonable accommodation to enable a person with a disability to satisfy the essential requisites of a job or enjoy the right or rights in question provided that the disability is known or should have been known by the covered entity.

   (b) Affirmative defense in disability cases. In any case where the need for reasonable accommodation is placed in issue, it shall be an affirmative defense that the person aggrieved by the alleged discriminatory practice could not, with reasonable accommodation, satisfy the essential requisites of the job or enjoy the right or rights in question.

   (c) Use of drugs or alcohol. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit a covered entity from (i) prohibiting the illegal use of drugs or the use of alcohol at the workplace or on duty impairment from the illegal use of drugs or the use of alcohol, or (ii) conducting drug testing which is otherwise lawful.

16. [Repealed.]

17. Disparate impact. 

   a.    An unlawful discriminatory practice based upon disparate impact is established when:

      (1) the commission or a person who may bring an action under chapter four or five of this title demonstrates that a policy or practice of a covered entity or a group of policies or practices of a covered entity results in a disparate impact to the detriment of any group protected by the provisions of this chapter; and

      (2) the covered entity fails to plead and prove as an affirmative defense that each such policy or practice bears a significant relationship to a significant business objective of the covered entity or does not contribute to the disparate impact; provided, however, that if the commission or such person who may bring an action demonstrates that a group of policies or practices results in a disparate impact, the commission or such person shall not be required to demonstrate which specific policies or practices within the group results in such disparate impact; provided further, that a policy or practice or group of policies or practices demonstrated to result in a disparate impact shall be unlawful where the commission or such person who may bring an action produces substantial evidence that an alternative policy or practice with less disparate impact is available to the covered entity and the covered entity fails to prove that such alternative policy or practice would not serve the covered entity as well. "Significant business objective" shall include, but not be limited to, successful performance of the job.

   b. The mere existence of a statistical imbalance between a covered entity's challenged demographic composition and the general population is not alone sufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact violation unless the general population is shown to be the relevant pool for comparison, the imbalance is shown to be statistically significant and there is an identifiable policy or practice or group of policies or practices that allegedly causes the imbalance.

   c. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to mandate or endorse the use of quotas; provided, however, that nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the scope of the commission's authority pursuant to sections 8-115 and 8-120 of this chapter or to affect court-ordered remedies or settlements that are otherwise in accordance with law.

18. Unlawful boycott or blacklist.

20. Relationship or association. The provisions of this section set forth as unlawful discriminatory practices shall be construed to prohibit such discrimination against a person because of the actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, uniformed service or alienage or citizenship status of a person with whom such person has a known relationship or association.

   (a) practices made unlawful by section 8-203 of this chapter, the inducement or encouragement by brokers or dealers of the use of fraudulent mortgage applications for the purchase of dwellings, or the direction based on race, creed, color or national origin by brokers or dealers of prospective purchasers or applicants to dwellings, or an unusually great incidence of solicitation are consistently occurring within the area, and that

   (b) such practices are causing, or are likely to cause, residents within the area to believe that:

      (1) property values in the area are declining, or about to decline rapidly; or

      (2) the area is experiencing, or is about to experience:

         (i) a declining level of maintenance of its housing stock; or

         (ii) an increase in criminal behavior; or

         (iii) a change in the racial, religious or ethnic composition of the schools in the area; or

      (3) the area is experiencing, or is about to experience, a material change in its racial, religious or ethnic composition; and

   (c) therefore, the temporary prohibition in the area of the real estate activities described in section 8-205 of this chapter is necessary to prevent a material change in the area's racial, religious or ethnic composition.

2. The commission may extend one or more times the designation of a non-solicitation area made pursuant to subdivision one of this section for a period of up to one year upon making written findings, based on substantial evidence introduced at a public hearing, that such extension is necessary to achieve the designation's purpose, as described in paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, provided, however, that no extension may be granted which, together with the original designation and all previous extensions, will maintain a non-solicitation area for a continuous period greater than two years. The public hearing on any extension shall be held not more than thirty days before the day on which the designation or earlier extension is scheduled to expire.

3. (a) The commission shall promptly announce by legal notice each designation made pursuant to subdivision one of this section and each extension made pursuant to subdivision two of this section, describing the area to which it applies by references to named streets and landmarks. Any designation shall take effect upon the completion of the publication required for legal notice. Any extension shall take effect at the time at which the designation or earlier extension would otherwise expire.

   (b) The commission shall maintain, and make available to all interested persons, a current listing of designated non-solicitation areas.

4. The commission may, at any time, terminate the designation of a non-solicitation area made pursuant to subdivision one of this section or the extension of a designation made pursuant to subdivision two of this section upon making findings, based on substantial evidence introduced at a public hearing, that the continuation of the designation or its extension is no longer necessary to achieve the designation's purpose, as described in this section.

2. (a) Any buyer, through or from a real estate broker or real estate dealer, of real property the last owner of which, excluding such broker or dealer, was induced to sell, exchange or transfer his or her property by acts committed by such broker or dealer in violation of section 8-203 or section 8-205 of this chapter may institute a civil action against such broker or dealer.

Chapter 3: Civil Rights Demonstration Protection
--------------------------------------------------
§ 8-301 Legislative declaration.  ::


It is hereby found that the letter and spirit of the constitution of the United States are being violated in some jurisdictions under color of law with the result that persons from this city and state, as well as from other states, are being subjected to discriminatory treatment in the exercise of their constitutional rights because of race or because they seek the removal of unconstitutional barriers to equal rights. Such persons, sometimes referred to as freedom riders and sit-ins, intent upon peaceful resistance to discrimination, segregation and the achievement of the constitutional rights of all persons in all jurisdictions of the United States, have suffered the stigma of criminal proceedings. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city to remove or to neutralize by affording to such residents appropriate relief to the fullest extent possible, the effect upon residents of this city of such criminal proceedings, resulting from the attempted use of public transportation facilities and other places of public accommodation.




§ 8-302 Removal of disability or disqualification.  ::


Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, no person shall be denied any license, right, benefit or privilege extended by this code, or suffer any other disability or disqualification thereunder, or be denied the right of employment by the city of New York, solely because of any arrest, apprehension, detention, indictment or other accusation, arraignment, trial, conviction or any other aspect of conviction or adjudication of a crime had under the jurisdiction of the courts of any state or of the United States, which is founded on an act or acts arising out of any peaceful demonstration or other peaceful activity, the object of which is to resist discriminatory treatment in any place of public accommodation as defined by section forty of the civil rights law, or to achieve equal rights for all persons regardless of race, creed, color or national origin.




Chapter 4: Civil Action To Eliminate Unlawful Discriminatory Practices
--------------------------------------------------
§ 8-401 Legislative declaration.  ::


The council finds that certain forms of unlawful discrimination are systemic in nature rooted in the operating conditions or policies of a business or industry. The council finds that the existence of systemic discrimination poses a substantial threat to, and inflicts significant injury upon, the city that is economic, social and moral in character, and is distinct from the injury sustained by individuals as an incident of such discrimination. The council finds that the potential for systemic discrimination exists in all areas of public life and that employment, housing and public accommodations are among the areas in which the economic effects of systemic discrimination are exemplified. The existence of systemic discrimination impedes the optimal efficiency of the labor market by, among other things, causing decisions to employ, promote or discharge persons to be based upon reasons other than qualifications and competence. Such discrimination impedes the optimal efficiency of the housing market and retards private investments in certain neighborhoods by causing decisions to lease or sell housing accommodations to be based upon discriminatory factors and not upon ability and willingness to lease or purchase property. The council finds that the reduction in the efficiency of the labor, housing and commercial markets has a detrimental effect on the city's economy, thereby reducing revenues and increasing costs to the city. The council finds that such economic injury to the city severely diminishes its capacity to meet the needs of those persons living and working in, and visiting, the city. The council finds further that the social and moral consequences of systemic discrimination are similarly injurious to the city in that systemic discrimination polarizes the city's communities, demoralizes its inhabitants and creates disrespect for the law, thereby frustrating the city's efforts to foster mutual respect and tolerance among its inhabitants and to promote a safe and secure environment. The council finds that the potential consequences to the city of this form of discrimination requires that the corporation counsel be expressly given the authority to institute a civil action to enforce the city's human rights law so as to supplement administrative means to prevent or remedy injury to the city.




§ 8-402 Civil action to eliminate unlawful discriminatory practices.  ::


a. Whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that a person or group of persons is engaged in pattern or practice that results in the denial to any person of the full enjoyment of any right secured by chapter one of this title, a civil action on behalf of the commission or the city may be commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction, by filing a complaint setting forth facts pertaining to such pattern or practice and requesting such relief as may be deemed necessary to insure the full enjoyment of the rights described in such chapter, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, damages, including punitive damages, and such other types of relief as are specified in subdivision a of section 8-120 of this title. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit (i) an aggrieved person from filing a complaint pursuant to section 8-109 of chapter one of this title or from commencing a civil action pursuant to chapter five of this title based upon the same facts pertaining to such a pattern or practice as are alleged in the civil action, or (ii) the commission from filing a commission-initiated complaint pursuant to section 8-109 of chapter one of this title alleging a pattern or practice of discrimination, provided that a civil action prusuant to this section shall not have previously been commenced.

b. A civil action commenced under this section must be commenced within three years after the alleged discriminatory practice occurred.

c. Such action may be instituted only by the corporation counsel, such attorneys employed by the city commission on human rights as are designated by the corporation counsel or other persons designated by the corporation counsel.




§ 8-403 Investigation.  ::


The corporation counsel may initiate any investigation to ascertain such facts as may be necessary for the commencement of a civil action pursuant to section 8-402 of this chapter, and in connection therewith shall have the power to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, to administer oaths and to examine such persons as are deemed necessary.




§ 8-404 Civil penalty.  ::


In any civil action commenced pursuant to section 8-402 of this chapter, the trier of fact may, to vindicate the public interest, impose upon any person who is found to have engaged in a pattern or practice that results in the denial to any person of the full enjoyment of any right secured by chapter one of this title a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars. In relation to determining the appropriate amount of civil penalties to be imposed pursuant to this section a liable party may plead and prove any relevant mitigating factor. Any civil penalties so recovered pursuant to this chapter shall be paid into the general fund of the city. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the city from recovering damages, including punitive damages, and other relief pursuant to section 8-402 of this chapter in addition to civil penalties.




Chapter 5: Civil Action By Persons Aggrieved By Unlawful Discriminatory Practices
--------------------------------------------------
§ 8-502 Civil action by persons aggrieved by unlawful discriminatory practices.  ::


a. Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be a person aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in chapter 1 of this title or by an act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter 6 of this title shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages, including punitive damages, and for injunctive relief and such other remedies as may be appropriate, unless such person has filed a complaint with the city commission on human rights or with the state division of human rights with respect to such alleged unlawful discriminatory practice or act of discriminatory harassment or violence. For purposes of this subdivision, the filing of a complaint with a federal agency pursuant to applicable federal law prohibiting discrimination which is subsequently referred to the city commission on human rights or to the state division of human rights pursuant to such law shall not be deemed to constitute the filing of a complaint under this subdivision.

b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of subdivision a of this section, where a complaint filed with the city commission on human rights or the state division on human rights is dismissed by the city commission on human rights pursuant to subdivisions a, b or c of section 8-113 of chapter one of this title, or by the state division of human rights pursuant to subdivision nine of section two hundred ninety-seven of the executive law either for administrative convenience or on the grounds that such person's election of an administrative remedy is annulled, an aggrieved person shall maintain all rights to commence a civil action pursuant to this chapter as if no such complaint had been filed.

c. The city commission on human rights and the corporation counsel shall each designate a representative authorized to receive copies of complaints in actions commenced in whole or in part pursuant to subdivision a of this section. Within 10 days after having commenced a civil action pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the plaintiff shall serve a copy of the complaint upon such authorized representatives.

d. A civil action commenced under this section must be commenced within three years after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice or act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter six of this title occurred. Upon the filing of a complaint with the city commission on human rights or the state division of human rights and during the pendency of such complaint and any court proceeding for review of the dismissal of such complaint, such three year limitations period shall be tolled.

e. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, where a complaint filed with the city commission on human rights or state division of human rights is dismissed for administrative convenience and such dismissal is due to the complainant's malfeasance, misfeasance or recalcitrance, the three year limitation period on commencing a civil action pursuant to this section shall not be tolled. Unwillingness to accept a reasonable proposed conciliation agreement shall not be considered malfeasance, misfeasance or recalcitrance.

f. The provisions of this section which provide a cause of action to persons claiming to be persons aggrieved by an act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter 6 of this title shall not apply to acts committed by members of the police department in the course of performing their official duties as police officers whether the police officer is on or off duty. This subdivision shall in no way affect rights or causes of action created by section 14-151.

g. In any civil action commenced pursuant to this section, the court, in its discretion, may award the prevailing party reasonable attorney's fees, expert fees and other costs. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term "prevailing" includes a plaintiff whose commencement of litigation has acted as a catalyst to effect policy change on the part of the defendant, regardless of whether that change has been implemented voluntarily, as a result of a settlement or as a result of a judgment in such plaintiff's favor. The court shall apply the hourly rate charged by attorneys of similar skill and experience litigating similar cases in New York county when it chooses to factor the hourly rate into the attorney's fee award.

h. 1. The term "person aggrieved" includes a person whose right created, granted or protected by chapters 1 or 6 of this title is violated by a covered entity directly or through conduct of the covered entity to which the person's agent or employee is subjected while the agent or employee was acting, or as a result of the agent or employee having acted, within the scope of the agency or employment relationship. For purposes of this subdivision, an agent or employee's protected status is imputed to that person's principal or employer when the agent or employee acts within the scope of the agency or employment relationship. It is irrelevant whether or not the covered entity knows of the agency or employment relationship.

   2. A person is aggrieved even if that person's only injury is the deprivation of a right granted or protected by chapters 1 or 6 of this title.

   3. This subdivision does not limit or exclude any other basis for a cause of action.






Chapter 6: Discriminatory Harassment Or Violence
--------------------------------------------------
§ 8-602 Civil action to enjoin discriminatory harassment or violence; equitable remedies.  ::


a. Whenever a person interferes by threats, intimidation or coercion or attempts to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion with the exercise or enjoyment by any person of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, the constitution or laws of this state, or local law of the city and such interference or attempted interference is motivated in whole or in part by the victim's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, whether children are, may or would be residing with such victim, marital status, partnership status, disability, or alienage or citizenship status as defined in chapter one of this title, the corporation counsel, at the request of the city commission on human rights or on his or her own initiative, may bring a civil action on behalf of the city for injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief in order to protect the peaceable exercise or enjoyment of the rights secured.

c. Any person who violates subdivision a or b of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than one hundred thousand dollars for each violation, which may be recovered by the corporation counsel in an action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction.




§ 8-604 Disposition of civil penalties.  ::


Any civil penalties recovered by the corporation counsel pursuant to this chapter shall be paid into the general fund of the city.




Chapter 7: Discriminatory Boycotts
--------------------------------------------------
§ 8-701 Legislative declaration.  ::


Boycotts or blacklists that are based on a person's race, color, creed, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, marital status, partnership status, gender, sexual orientation, or disability pose a menace to the city's foundation and institutions. In contrast to protests that are in reaction to an unlawful discriminatory practice, connected with a labor dispute or associated with other speech or activities that are protected by the first amendment discriminatory boycotts cause havoc, divide the citizenry and do not serve a legitimate purpose. The council declares that discriminatory boycotts are a dangerously insidious form of prejudice and hereby establishes a procedure for expeditiously investigating allegations of this type of prejudice, assuring that the council and mayor are duly alerted to the existence of such activity and combating discriminatory boycotts or blacklists.




§ 8-702 Definitions.  ::


When used in this chapter

(1) The term "discriminatory boycott or blacklist" means any act that is an unlawful discriminatory practice under subdivision eighteen of section 8-107 of chapter one of this title.

(2) The term "commission" means the New York city commission on human rights.

(3) The term "council" means the council of the city of New York.




§ 8-703 Investigative reporting requirements.  ::


The following requirements shall apply to all complaints alleging that a discriminatory boycott or blacklist is occurring:

(1) The commission shall begin an investigation within twenty-four hours of the filing of a complaint which alleges that a discriminatory boycott or blacklist is occurring.

(2) Within three days after initiating such an investigation, the commission shall file a written report with the mayor. The report shall state:

   (a) the allegations contained in the complaint;

   (b) whether the commission has reason to believe a discriminatory boycott or blacklist is taking place; and

   (c) steps the commission has taken to resolve the dispute.

(3) If it is stated within the report described in subdivision two of this section that the commission has reason to believe that a discriminatory boycott or blacklist has taken place, within thirty days after filing such report, the commission shall file a second report with the mayor and the council. This second report shall contain:

   (a) a brief description of the allegations contained in the complaint;

   (b) a determination of whether probable cause exists to believe a discriminatory boycott or blacklist is taking place;

   (c) a recitation of the facts that form the basis of the commission's determination of probable cause; and

   (d) if the boycott or blacklist is continuing at the date of the report, a description of all actions the commission or other city agency has taken or will undertake to resolve the dispute.

(4) If a finding of probable cause is not contained in the report required by subdivision three of this section and the boycott or blacklist continues for more than twenty days subsequent to the report's release, then, upon demand of the mayor or council the commission shall update such report. Report updates shall detail:

   (a) whether or not the commission presently has probable cause to believe a discriminatory boycott or blacklist is taking place; and

   (b) all new activity the commission or other city agency has taken or will undertake to resolve the dispute.

(5) If the commission determines that the disclosure of any information in a report required by this section may interfere with or compromise a pending investigation or efforts to resolve the dispute by mediation or conciliation, it shall file the report without such information and state in the report the reasons for omitting such information.

Chapter 9: Actions By Victims of Gender-motivated Violence
--------------------------------------------------
§ 8-901 Short Title.  ::


This local law shall be known as the "Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence protection Act".




§ 8-902 Declaration of Legislative Findings and Intent.  ::


Gender-motivated violence inflicts serious physical, psychological, emotional and economic harm on its victims. Congressional findings have documented that gender-motivated violence is widespread throughout the United States, representing the leading cause of injuries to women ages 15 to 44. Further statistics have shown that three out of four women will be the victim of a violent crime sometime during their lives, and as many as four million women a year are victims of domestic violence. Senate hearings, various task forces and the United States Department of Justice have concluded that victims of gender-motivated violence frequently face a climate of condescension indifference and hostility in the court system and have documented the legal system's hostility towards sexual assault and domestic violence claims. Recognizing this widespread problem, Congress in 1994 provided victims of gender-motivated violence with a cause of action in federal court through the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) . In a May 15, 2000 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that the Constitution provided no basis for a federal cause of action by victims of gender-motivated violence against their perpetrators either under the Commerce Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In so ruling the Court held that it could "think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims." In light of the void left by the Supreme Court's decision, this Council finds that victims of gender-motivated violence should have a private right of action against their perpetrators under the Administrative Code. This private right of action aims to resolve the difficulty that victims face in seeking court remedies by providing an officially sanctioned and legitimate cause of action for seeking redress for injuries resulting from gender-motivated violence.




§ 8-903 Definitions.  ::


For purposes of this chapter:

a. "Crime of violence" means an act or series of acts that would constitute a misdemeanor or felony against the person as defined in state or federal law or that would constitute a misdemeanor or felony against property as defined in state or federal law if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction.

b. "Crime of violence motivated by gender" means a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's gender.




§ 8-904 Civil Cause of Action.  ::


Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be injured by an individual who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender as defined in section 8-903 of this chapter, shall have a cause of action against such individual in any court of competent jurisdiction for any or all of the following relief:

1. compensatory and punitive damages;

2. injunctive and declaratory relief;

3. attorneys' fees and costs;

4. such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.




§ 8-905 Limitations.  ::


a. A civil action under this chapter must be commenced within seven years after the alleged crime of violence motivated by gender as defined in section 8-903 of this chapter occurred. If, however, due to injury or disability resulting from an act or acts giving rise to a cause of action under this chapter, or due to infancy as defined in the civil procedure law and rules, a person entitled to commence an action under this chapter is unable to do so at the time such cause of action accrues, then the time within which the action must be commenced shall be extended to seven years after the inability to commence the action ceases.

b. Except as otherwise permitted by law, nothing in this chapter entitles a person to a cause of action for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be domonstrated, by preponderance of the evidence, to be motivated by gender as defined in Section 8-903.

c. Nothing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under this chapter.




§ 8-906 Burden of Proof.  ::


Conviction of a crime arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or event giving rise to a cause of action under this chapter shall be considered conclusive proof of the underlying facts of that crime for purposes of an action brought under this chapter. That such crime was a crime of violence motivated by gender must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.




§ 8-907 Severability.  ::


If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or other portion of this local law is, for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction such portion shall be deemed severable, and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this law, which remaining portions shall continue in full force and effect.




Chapter 10: Equal Access To Human Services
--------------------------------------------------
§ 8-1001 Short title.  ::


This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Equal Access to Human Services Act of 2003."




§ 8-1002 Definitions.  ::
